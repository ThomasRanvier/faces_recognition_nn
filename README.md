# Faces recognition neural network

This is the fifth assignment of the Fundamentals of artificial intelligence course at the University of UmeÃ¥.

The goal was to classify images of faces of dimension 20x20, between the four emotions, happy, sad, mischievous or mad.
To do so we had to implement a single layer perceptron, a neural network that has no hidden layer.

To run the program run the following command from the folder containing the sources:
> ./faces.sh images.txt keys.txt test.txt
